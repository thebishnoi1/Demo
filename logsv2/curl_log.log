    [entry_1000008] => A wise woman named Bertice Berry once said, “When you walk with purpose you collide with destiny.” With this in mind, Giants At Play is the opposite of a safety manual, it is rather a dangerous guide to ensure such collisions not only take place but frequent the life of the reader. Part I, “Giants At Play,” is about learning to recognize and courageously encounter the many and ever-accessible giants that passionately live and play among us. In this sense, “giants” can be anything that awakens you to your greatness, destiny, or the unlimited potential that is your life. Ideas, art, mentors, epic novels, movies, philosophies, relationships, spiritual teachers, inventions, meditations, stories, nature, sex, music, gods, and goddesses all flood this world with their magical movements in order to somehow catch our eye and catapult our hearts onto a journey into the sky. In this way, like fireworks our lives bring magnificence, brilliance, and awe to all those within sight.  Part II, “A Cure For The Bitter Bones,” is meant to be an ecstasy-inducing elixir for any who’ve grown old, tired, or rigid, having skinned their chin or elbows while participating in the hard game of life. Considering life’s massive let downs and the extreme patience required for the achievement of our goals, self-mastery, and the fulfillment of our destiny, it is a small wonder that we would need such medicinal strong drink for the journey we face. My hope is that together, these two concepts of courageously learning to play among “Giants” and frequently ingesting “A Cure For The Bitter Bones” would help you to find wisdom, courage, and acceptance to encounter your destiny. Live your dream. Order this ebook and \"collide with\" your dangerous destiny now! <br /><br />Reviews: <br /><br />“Giants At Play is a wonderful playground for the mind. Each poem transports you to another world: A place of empowerment, beauty, optimism, sensuality, fantasy, and limitless possibilities. As I read each poem again and again, my enjoyment increases and its meaning deepens. I am gently guided back into the meditative bliss I felt as a child when I would open my window and breathe the summer night air as my mind wandered while gazing up at the stars. Dust off the cobwebs of your imagination and prepare to unlock the limitless possibilities and confident ability you felt as a child. You will believe you can fly again!”   <br />~ Emily Wolfer, (Kansas City, MO) <br /><br />“Curtis Jones is a modern day Hafiz—creative, engaging, and inspiring. He will touch your soul: a poet who speaks to your highest self, leads you to love, and teaches you to treasure what is good, true, and beautiful.”   <br />~ Josh Kalsbeek (San José, CA) <br /><br />“Curtis Jones’ Giants At Play is a breath of fresh air. Filled with thought-provoking quotes and eloquent poetry, the reader is moved to examine life inside out. Transitioning from inspiration to declaration, Curtis Jones was able to entertain the idea that life was meant to be lived and not just witnessed.”   <br />~ Solomon Lee (Buena Park, CA) <br /><br />“Sometimes we forget that even the simplest of words can link together to radiate an idea, a feeling so complex and so genuinely real. It spurs us on to think and feel more profoundly, wake up tomorrow and do it all over again. Giants At Play is precisely this, a thrust into the depths of ourselves and the encouragement to embrace it.”   <br />~ Bianca Anjuli Villegas (West Palm Beach, FL) <br /><br />“Reading through Giants At Play is like turning the knob on a gumball machine. You know you will receive a piece of the sweet candy inside, but which one will it be? A moving lyric? A poetic picture? A word of wisdom? Curtis Tyrone Jones has paid attention to the world, engaged it as it engaged him, and now shares the richness of his experience with his brothers and sisters. Giants At Play encourages us and dares us to be encouraged.”   <br />~ David Augustus, (Wilmington, NC)<br />

    [input_1] => Giants At Play: Finding Wisdom, Courage, And Acceptance To Encounter Your Destiny by Curtis Tyrone Jones
    [input_2] => A wise woman named Bertice Berry once said, “When you walk with purpose you collide with destiny.” With this in mind, Giants At Play is the opposite of a safety manual, it is rather a dangerous guide to ensure such collisions not only take place but frequent the life of the reader. Part I, “Giants At Play,” is about learning to recognize and courageously encounter the many and ever-accessible giants that passionately live and play among us. In this sense, “giants” can be anything that awakens you to your greatness, destiny, or the unlimited potential that is your life. Ideas, art, mentors, epic novels, movies, philosophies, relationships, spiritual teachers, inventions, meditations, stories, nature, sex, music, gods, and goddesses all flood this world with their magical movements in order to somehow catch our eye and catapult our hearts onto a journey into the sky. In this way, like fireworks our lives bring magnificence, brilliance, and awe to all those within sight.  Part II, “A Cure For The Bitter Bones,” is meant to be an ecstasy-inducing elixir for any who’ve grown old, tired, or rigid, having skinned their chin or elbows while participating in the hard game of life. Considering life’s massive let downs and the extreme patience required for the achievement of our goals, self-mastery, and the fulfillment of our destiny, it is a small wonder that we would need such medicinal strong drink for the journey we face. My hope is that together, these two concepts of courageously learning to play among “Giants” and frequently ingesting “A Cure For The Bitter Bones” would help you to find wisdom, courage, and acceptance to encounter your destiny. Live your dream. Order this ebook and \"collide with\" your dangerous destiny now! <br /><br />Reviews: <br /><br />“Giants At Play is a wonderful playground for the mind. Each poem transports you to another world: A place of empowerment, beauty, optimism, sensuality, fantasy, and limitless possibilities. As I read each poem again and again, my enjoyment increases and its meaning deepens. I am gently guided back into the meditative bliss I felt as a child when I would open my window and breathe the summer night air as my mind wandered while gazing up at the stars. Dust off the cobwebs of your imagination and prepare to unlock the limitless possibilities and confident ability you felt as a child. You will believe you can fly again!”   <br />~ Emily Wolfer, (Kansas City, MO) <br /><br />“Curtis Jones is a modern day Hafiz—creative, engaging, and inspiring. He will touch your soul: a poet who speaks to your highest self, leads you to love, and teaches you to treasure what is good, true, and beautiful.”   <br />~ Josh Kalsbeek (San José, CA) <br /><br />“Curtis Jones’ Giants At Play is a breath of fresh air. Filled with thought-provoking quotes and eloquent poetry, the reader is moved to examine life inside out. Transitioning from inspiration to declaration, Curtis Jones was able to entertain the idea that life was meant to be lived and not just witnessed.”   <br />~ Solomon Lee (Buena Park, CA) <br /><br />“Sometimes we forget that even the simplest of words can link together to radiate an idea, a feeling so complex and so genuinely real. It spurs us on to think and feel more profoundly, wake up tomorrow and do it all over again. Giants At Play is precisely this, a thrust into the depths of ourselves and the encouragement to embrace it.”   <br />~ Bianca Anjuli Villegas (West Palm Beach, FL) <br /><br />“Reading through Giants At Play is like turning the knob on a gumball machine. You know you will receive a piece of the sweet candy inside, but which one will it be? A moving lyric? A poetic picture? A word of wisdom? Curtis Tyrone Jones has paid attention to the world, engaged it as it engaged him, and now shares the richness of his experience with his brothers and sisters. Giants At Play encourages us and dares us to be encouraged.”   <br />~ David Augustus, (Wilmington, NC)<br />

    [synopsis] => A wise woman named Bertice Berry once said, “When you walk with purpose you collide with destiny.” With this in mind, Giants At Play is the opposite of a safety manual, it is rather a dangerous guide to ensure such collisions not only take place but frequent the life of the reader. Part I, “Giants At Play,” is about learning to recognize and courageously encounter the many and ever-accessible giants that passionately live and play among us. In this sense, “giants” can be anything that awakens you to your greatness, destiny, or the unlimited potential that is your life. Ideas, art, mentors, epic novels, movies, philosophies, relationships, spiritual teachers, inventions, meditations, stories, nature, sex, music, gods, and goddesses all flood this world with their magical movements in order to somehow catch our eye and catapult our hearts onto a journey into the sky. In this way, like fireworks our lives bring magnificence, brilliance, and awe to all those within sight.  Part II, “A Cure For The Bitter Bones,” is meant to be an ecstasy-inducing elixir for any who’ve grown old, tired, or rigid, having skinned their chin or elbows while participating in the hard game of life. Considering life’s massive let downs and the extreme patience required for the achievement of our goals, self-mastery, and the fulfillment of our destiny, it is a small wonder that we would need such medicinal strong drink for the journey we face. My hope is that together, these two concepts of courageously learning to play among “Giants” and frequently ingesting “A Cure For The Bitter Bones” would help you to find wisdom, courage, and acceptance to encounter your destiny.

    [field-a6c77a955d5407a] => A wise woman named Bertice Berry once said, “When you walk with purpose you collide with destiny.” With this in mind, Giants At Play is the opposite of a safety manual, it is rather a dangerous guide to ensure such collisions not only take place but frequent the life of the reader. Part I, “Giants At Play,” is about learning to recognize and courageously encounter the many and ever-accessible giants that passionately live and play among us. In this sense, “giants” can be anything that awakens you to your greatness, destiny, or the unlimited potential that is your life. Ideas, art, mentors, epic novels, movies, philosophies, relationships, spiritual teachers, inventions, meditations, stories, nature, sex, music, gods, and goddesses all flood this world with their magical movements in order to somehow catch our eye and catapult our hearts onto a journey into the sky. In this way, like fireworks our lives bring magnificence, brilliance, and awe to all those within sight.  Part II, “A Cure For The Bitter Bones,” is meant to be an ecstasy-inducing elixir for any who’ve grown old, tired, or rigid, having skinned their chin or elbows while participating in the hard game of life. Considering life’s massive let downs and the extreme patience required for the achievement of our goals, self-mastery, and the fulfillment of our destiny, it is a small wonder that we would need such medicinal strong drink for the journey we face. My hope is that together, these two concepts of courageously learning to play among “Giants” and frequently ingesting “A Cure For The Bitter Bones” would help you to find wisdom, courage, and acceptance to encounter your destiny. Live your dream. Order this ebook and \"collide with\" your dangerous destiny now! <br /><br />Reviews: <br /><br />“Giants At Play is a wonderful playground for the mind. Each poem transports you to another world: A place of empowerment, beauty, optimism, sensuality, fantasy, and limitless possibilities. As I read each poem again and again, my enjoyment increases and its meaning deepens. I am gently guided back into the meditative bliss I felt as a child when I would open my window and breathe the summer night air as my mind wandered while gazing up at the stars. Dust off the cobwebs of your imagination and prepare to unlock the limitless possibilities and confident ability you felt as a child. You will believe you can fly again!”   <br />~ Emily Wolfer, (Kansas City, MO) <br /><br />“Curtis Jones is a modern day Hafiz—creative, engaging, and inspiring. He will touch your soul: a poet who speaks to your highest self, leads you to love, and teaches you to treasure what is good, true, and beautiful.”   <br />~ Josh Kalsbeek (San José, CA) <br /><br />“Curtis Jones’ Giants At Play is a breath of fresh air. Filled with thought-provoking quotes and eloquent poetry, the reader is moved to examine life inside out. Transitioning from inspiration to declaration, Curtis Jones was able to entertain the idea that life was meant to be lived and not just witnessed.”   <br />~ Solomon Lee (Buena Park, CA) <br /><br />“Sometimes we forget that even the simplest of words can link together to radiate an idea, a feeling so complex and so genuinely real. It spurs us on to think and feel more profoundly, wake up tomorrow and do it all over again. Giants At Play is precisely this, a thrust into the depths of ourselves and the encouragement to embrace it.”   <br />~ Bianca Anjuli Villegas (West Palm Beach, FL) <br /><br />“Reading through Giants At Play is like turning the knob on a gumball machine. You know you will receive a piece of the sweet candy inside, but which one will it be? A moving lyric? A poetic picture? A word of wisdom? Curtis Tyrone Jones has paid attention to the world, engaged it as it engaged him, and now shares the richness of his experience with his brothers and sisters. Giants At Play encourages us and dares us to be encouraged.”   <br />~ David Augustus, (Wilmington, NC)<br />

    [entry_1000008] => Welcome to the age of specialization.  The EXPERT era as I like to call it.  We live in the most affluent and comfortable era in the history of mankind.  It has all come about due to specialization.  For the do-it-yourselfer this is a blessing and a curse.   I remember changing the spark plugs in my car and giving it a tune up.  I even recall putting a new carburetor on.  Those days are long gone – do cars even have carburetors any longer?  Most tasks now require unique skills and experience to solve unique problems and issues.  Experts we call them.<br /> <br />On the pages that follow are just such a group of people, experts all with the experience, education and skills to match.  You’ll hear stories of challenge and conflict, you’ll get expert advice that could cost you thousands of dollars, and our hope is that you will also be encouraged to be the expert in your field that someone else needs YOU to be.<br /> <br />Enjoy the stories but don’t lose sight of the years and cost that it took to get these experts to where they are today.<br /><br />We want to thank all the experts and authors who made this book possible - Rob Kosberg, Marc Feinberg, Andrea Szebeni, Melvin Claxton, Damien Charley, Adrienne Williams, Anne Barbieri , Annmarie Ware, Jim Hansen, Peter Luther, Tom Evans, Yolanda Cintron, Elizabeth Smith , Karen Simpson-Hankins

    [synopsis] => Welcome to the age of specialization.  The EXPERT era as I like to call it.  We live in the most affluent and comfortable era in the history of mankind.  It has all come about due to specialization.  For the do-it-yourselfer this is a blessing and a curse.   I remember changing the spark plugs in my car and giving it a tune up.  I even recall putting a new carburetor on.  Those days are long gone – do cars even have carburetors any longer?  Most tasks now require unique skills and experience to solve unique problems and issues.  Experts we call them.<br /> <br />On the pages that follow are just such a group of people, experts all with the experience, education and skills to match.  You’ll hear stories of challenge and conflict, you’ll get expert advice that could cost you thousands of dollars, and our hope is that you will also be encouraged to be the expert in your field that someone else needs YOU to be.<br /> <br />Enjoy the stories but don’t lose sight of the years and cost that it took to get these experts to where they are today.<br /><br />We want to thank all the experts and authors who made this book possible - Rob Kosberg, Marc Feinberg, Andrea Szebeni, Melvin Claxton, Damien Charley, Adrienne Williams, Anne Barbieri , Annmarie Ware, Jim Hansen, Peter Luther, Tom Evans, Yolanda Cintron, Elizabeth Smith , Karen Simpson-Hankins

    [body] => Welcome to the age of specialization.  The EXPERT era as I like to call it.  We live in the most affluent and comfortable era in the history of mankind.  It has all come about due to specialization.  For the do-it-yourselfer this is a blessing and a curse.   I remember changing the spark plugs in my car and giving it a tune up.  I even recall putting a new carburetor on.  Those days are long gone – do cars even have carburetors any longer?  Most tasks now require unique skills and experience to solve unique problems and issues.  Experts we call them. On the pages that follow are just such a group of people, experts all with the experience, education and skills to match.  You’ll hear stories of challenge and conflict, you’ll get expert advice that could cost you thousands of dollars, and our hope is that you will also be encouraged to be the expert in your field that someone else needs YOU to be. Enjoy the stories but don’t lose sight of the years and cost that it took to get these experts to where they are today.We want to thank all the experts and authors who made this book possible - Rob Kosberg, Marc Feinberg, Andrea Szebeni, Melvin Claxton, Damien Charley, Adrienne Williams, Anne Barbieri , Annmarie Ware, Jim Hansen, Peter Luther, Tom Evans, Yolanda Cintron, Elizabeth Smith , Karen Simpson-Hankins

Of those who don’t, very few know how to use the small amount of time they do study to help them achieve the grades they are after. In either case, this book will help you overcome any obstacles you face when it comes to spending less time studying while also improving your grades. <br /><br />The techniques suggested in this book have been used by Despina Gavoyannis and countless other students she has worked with to achieve great academic success. Despina went from failing to placing in the top 4% of the state in less than five months, and in her final year of high school nonetheless. Using the methods she describes in this book, you can also achieve the same, if not completely surpass these results. <br /><br />That’s what study hacking is all about. This is the book for you if you find that you: <br /><br />- Are uncertain about what to do after you finish school <br />- Know you have bad habits which are preventing you from succeeding <br />- Struggle to be organised or to manage your time <br />- Find that you get stressed out by upcoming exams, university applications or the thought of what to do once you finish school <br /><br />Going well in school can be a tough process. Becoming a study hacker will make your success in this process as effortless and as easy as possible!

Light is the most important tool to a photographer but we also need Light in our lives in order to live radiant lives. The book is compiled into 3 sections. Seeing the Beauty. Capturing the Moment. Sharing the Light.  <br /><br />SECTION 1 SEEING THE BEAUTY <br />Using a nature theme of flowers, wildlife and landscapes, natural lighting is discussed along with beauty in our surroundings and from within. The author shares how her family saw the beauty in old granaries to make a beautiful home. She also earned to live a radiant life though she faced many struggles as a child from adoption, poor vision, dyslexia, being left-handed, speech difficulties etc.  <br /><br />SECTION 2 CAPTURING THE MOMENT uses a tropical theme of waves, trees and oceanscapes. Showing how to paint with light is then paralleled with life experiences and the importance of how words impacted a broken teenager and gave her the confidence to soar. The challenges of being adopted are discussed. If you have ever adopted a pet you will also appreciate this section.  <br /><br />SECTION 3 SHARING THE LIGHT is the final section of the book and scenes from sunrise, sunset and black and white shots are shared. Flash lighting is the theme because of it\'s speed. The author then shares personal stories of her brother\'s final days and how rainbows are still painted for you and me today.  <br /><br />Storms come and come quickly. Doubts come. Death captures the love of your life. If you are in a storm - you know what I am talking about. If you are not, this book is still for you. Events may be in your forecast and you can be prepared for the sting of the storm. The storm does pass and tomorrow can be a forecast full of sunshine, hope, faith, and promise. You can count on light to change your perspective, bring life into focus and help your goals come together just when you need it the most.  <br /><br />If this book leaves you equipped to capture some great images by utilizing lighting techniques - great. If it helps you see the beauty in your own experiences - even better. If the personal stories and thoughts encourage and challenge you to capture the moment - fantastic. If you see that having the Light in your life can leave you living a radiant life - you will have received the message of the book.

    [title] => Light Changes Everything: The Most Powerful Tool To A Photographer and For A Radiant Life
    [author] => Sandra Graham
    [description] => This book is compiled with text, quotes and more than 50 professional photography images. Without light there is complete darkness. Light is the most important tool to a photographer but we also need Light in our lives in order to live radiant lives. The book is compiled into 3 sections. Seeing the Beauty. Capturing the Moment. Sharing the Light.  SECTION 1 SEEING THE BEAUTY Using a nature theme of flowers, wildlife and landscapes, natural lighting is discussed along with beauty in our surroundings and from within. The author shares how her family saw the beauty in old granaries to make a beautiful home. She also earned to live a radiant life though she faced many struggles as a child from adoption, poor vision, dyslexia, being left-handed, speech difficulties etc.  SECTION 2 CAPTURING THE MOMENT uses a tropical theme of waves, trees and oceanscapes. Showing how to paint with light is then paralleled with life experiences and the importance of how words impacted a broken teenager and gave her the confidence to soar. The challenges of being adopted are discussed. If you have ever adopted a pet you will also appreciate this section.  SECTION 3 SHARING THE LIGHT is the final section of the book and scenes from sunrise, sunset and black and white shots are shared. Flash lighting is the theme because of it\'s speed. The author then shares personal stories of her brother\'s final days and how rainbows are still painted for you and me today.  Storms come and come quickly. Doubts come. Death captures the love of your life. If you are in a storm - you know what I am talking about. If you are not, this book is still for you. Events may be in your forecast and you can be prepared for the sting of the storm. The storm does pass and tomorrow can be a forecast full of sunshine, hope, faith, and promise. You can count on light to change your perspective, bring life into focus and help your goals come together just when you need it the most.  If this book leaves you equipped to capture some great images by utilizing lighting techniques - great. If it helps you see the beauty in your own experiences - even better. If the personal stories and thoughts encourage and challenge you to capture the moment - fantastic. If you see that having the Light in your life can leave you living a radiant life - you will have received the message of the book.

    [field4] => This book is compiled with text, quotes and more than 50 professional photography images. Without light there is complete darkness. Light is the most important tool to a photographer but we also need Light in our lives in order to live radiant lives. The book is compiled into 3 sections. Seeing the Beauty. Capturing the Moment. Sharing the Light.  SECTION 1 SEEING THE BEAUTY Using a nature theme of flowers, wildlife and landscapes, natural lighting is discussed along with beauty in our surroundings and from within. The author shares how her family saw the beauty in old granaries to make a beautiful home. She also earned to live a radiant life though she faced many struggles as a child from adoption, poor vision, dyslexia, being left-handed, speech difficulties etc.  SECTION 2 CAPTURING THE MOMENT uses a tropical theme of waves, trees and oceanscapes. Showing how to paint with light is then paralleled with life experiences and the importance of how words impacted a broken teenager and gave her the confidence to soar. The challenges of being adopted are discussed. If you have ever adopted a pet you will also appreciate this section.  SECTION 3 SHARING THE LIGHT is the final section of the book and scenes from sunrise, sunset and black and white shots are shared. Flash lighting is the theme because of it\'s speed. The author then shares personal stories of her brother\'s final days and how rainbows are still painted for you and me today.  Storms come and come quickly. Doubts come. Death captures the love of your life. If you are in a storm - you know what I am talking about. If you are not, this book is still for you. Events may be in your forecast and you can be prepared for the sting of the storm. The storm does pass and tomorrow can be a forecast full of sunshine, hope, faith, and promise. You can count on light to change your perspective, bring life into focus and help your goals come together just when you need it the most.  If this book leaves you equipped to capture some great images by utilizing lighting techniques - great. If it helps you see the beauty in your own experiences - even better. If the personal stories and thoughts encourage and challenge you to capture the moment - fantastic. If you see that having the Light in your life can leave you living a radiant life - you will have received the message of the book.

    [field4] => This book is compiled with text, quotes and more than 50 professional photography images. Without light there is complete darkness. Light is the most important tool to a photographer but we also need Light in our lives in order to live radiant lives. The book is compiled into 3 sections. Seeing the Beauty. Capturing the Moment. Sharing the Light.  SECTION 1 SEEING THE BEAUTY Using a nature theme of flowers, wildlife and landscapes, natural lighting is discussed along with beauty in our surroundings and from within. The author shares how her family saw the beauty in old granaries to make a beautiful home. She also earned to live a radiant life though she faced many struggles as a child from adoption, poor vision, dyslexia, being left-handed, speech difficulties etc.  SECTION 2 CAPTURING THE MOMENT uses a tropical theme of waves, trees and oceanscapes. Showing how to paint with light is then paralleled with life experiences and the importance of how words impacted a broken teenager and gave her the confidence to soar. The challenges of being adopted are discussed. If you have ever adopted a pet you will also appreciate this section.  SECTION 3 SHARING THE LIGHT is the final section of the book and scenes from sunrise, sunset and black and white shots are shared. Flash lighting is the theme because of it\'s speed. The author then shares personal stories of her brother\'s final days and how rainbows are still painted for you and me today.  Storms come and come quickly. Doubts come. Death captures the love of your life. If you are in a storm - you know what I am talking about. If you are not, this book is still for you. Events may be in your forecast and you can be prepared for the sting of the storm. The storm does pass and tomorrow can be a forecast full of sunshine, hope, faith, and promise. You can count on light to change your perspective, bring life into focus and help your goals come together just when you need it the most.  If this book leaves you equipped to capture some great images by utilizing lighting techniques - great. If it helps you see the beauty in your own experiences - even better. If the personal stories and thoughts encourage and challenge you to capture the moment - fantastic. If you see that having the Light in your life can leave you living a radiant life - you will have received the message of the book.

    [entry_785737396] => This book is compiled with text, quotes and more than 50 professional photography images. Without light there is complete darkness. Light is the most important tool to a photographer but we also need Light in our lives in order to live radiant lives. The book is compiled into 3 sections. Seeing the Beauty. Capturing the Moment. Sharing the Light.  SECTION 1 SEEING THE BEAUTY Using a nature theme of flowers, wildlife and landscapes, natural lighting is discussed along with beauty in our surroundings and from within. The author shares how her family saw the beauty in old granaries to make a beautiful home. She also earned to live a radiant life though she faced many struggles as a child from adoption, poor vision, dyslexia, being left-handed, speech difficulties etc.  SECTION 2 CAPTURING THE MOMENT uses a tropical theme of waves, trees and oceanscapes. Showing how to paint with light is then paralleled with life experiences and the importance of how words impacted a broken teenager and gave her the confidence to soar. The challenges of being adopted are discussed. If you have ever adopted a pet you will also appreciate this section.  SECTION 3 SHARING THE LIGHT is the final section of the book and scenes from sunrise, sunset and black and white shots are shared. Flash lighting is the theme because of it\'s speed. The author then shares personal stories of her brother\'s final days and how rainbows are still painted for you and me today.  Storms come and come quickly. Doubts come. Death captures the love of your life. If you are in a storm - you know what I am talking about. If you are not, this book is still for you. Events may be in your forecast and you can be prepared for the sting of the storm. The storm does pass and tomorrow can be a forecast full of sunshine, hope, faith, and promise. You can count on light to change your perspective, bring life into focus and help your goals come together just when you need it the most.  If this book leaves you equipped to capture some great images by utilizing lighting techniques - great. If it helps you see the beauty in your own experiences - even better. If the personal stories and thoughts encourage and challenge you to capture the moment - fantastic. If you see that having the Light in your life can leave you living a radiant life - you will have received the message of the book.

The author shares how her family saw the beauty in old granaries to make a beautiful home. She also earned to live a radiant life though she faced many struggles as a child from adoption, poor vision, dyslexia, being left-handed, speech difficulties etc.  <br /><br />SECTION 2 CAPTURING THE MOMENT uses a tropical theme of waves, trees and oceanscapes. Showing how to paint with light is then paralleled with life experiences and the importance of how words impacted a broken teenager and gave her the confidence to soar.

Events may be in your forecast and you can be prepared for the sting of the storm. The storm does pass and tomorrow can be a forecast full of sunshine, hope, faith, and promise. You can count on light to change your perspective, bring life into focus and help your goals come together just when you need it the most.  <br /><br />If this book leaves you equipped to capture some great images by utilizing lighting techniques - great. If it helps you see the beauty in your own experiences - even better. If the personal stories and thoughts encourage and challenge you to capture the moment - fantastic. If you see that having the Light in your life can leave you living a radiant life - you will have received the message of the book.

    [field-a6c77a955d5407a] => This book is compiled with text, quotes and more than 50 professional photography images. Without light there is complete darkness. Light is the most important tool to a photographer but we also need Light in our lives in order to live radiant lives. The book is compiled into 3 sections. Seeing the Beauty. Capturing the Moment. Sharing the Light.  <br /><br />SECTION 1 SEEING THE BEAUTY <br />Using a nature theme of flowers, wildlife and landscapes, natural lighting is discussed along with beauty in our surroundings and from within. The author shares how her family saw the beauty in old granaries to make a beautiful home. She also earned to live a radiant life though she faced many struggles as a child from adoption, poor vision, dyslexia, being left-handed, speech difficulties etc.  <br /><br />SECTION 2 CAPTURING THE MOMENT uses a tropical theme of waves, trees and oceanscapes. Showing how to paint with light is then paralleled with life experiences and the importance of how words impacted a broken teenager and gave her the confidence to soar. The challenges of being adopted are discussed. If you have ever adopted a pet you will also appreciate this section.  <br /><br />SECTION 3 SHARING THE LIGHT is the final section of the book and scenes from sunrise, sunset and black and white shots are shared. Flash lighting is the theme because of it\'s speed. The author then shares personal stories of her brother\'s final days and how rainbows are still painted for you and me today.  <br /><br />Storms come and come quickly. Doubts come. Death captures the love of your life. If you are in a storm - you know what I am talking about. If you are not, this book is still for you. Events may be in your forecast and you can be prepared for the sting of the storm. The storm does pass and tomorrow can be a forecast full of sunshine, hope, faith, and promise. You can count on light to change your perspective, bring life into focus and help your goals come together just when you need it the most.  <br /><br />If this book leaves you equipped to capture some great images by utilizing lighting techniques - great. If it helps you see the beauty in your own experiences - even better. If the personal stories and thoughts encourage and challenge you to capture the moment - fantastic. If you see that having the Light in your life can leave you living a radiant life - you will have received the message of the book.

    [item_meta[88]] => This book is compiled with text, quotes and more than 50 professional photography images. Without light there is complete darkness. Light is the most important tool to a photographer but we also need Light in our lives in order to live radiant lives. The book is compiled into 3 sections. Seeing the Beauty. Capturing the Moment. Sharing the Light.  <br /><br />SECTION 1 SEEING THE BEAUTY <br />Using a nature theme of flowers, wildlife and landscapes, natural lighting is discussed along with beauty in our surroundings and from within. The author shares how her family saw the beauty in old granaries to make a beautiful home. She also earned to live a radiant life though she faced many struggles as a child from adoption, poor vision, dyslexia, being left-handed, speech difficulties etc.  <br /><br />SECTION 2 CAPTURING THE MOMENT uses a tropical theme of waves, trees and oceanscapes. Showing how to paint with light is then paralleled with life experiences and the importance of how words impacted a broken teenager and gave her the confidence to soar. The challenges of being adopted are discussed. If you have ever adopted a pet you will also appreciate this section.  <br /><br />SECTION 3 SHARING THE LIGHT is the final section of the book and scenes from sunrise, sunset and black and white shots are shared. Flash lighting is the theme because of it\'s speed. The author then shares personal stories of her brother\'s final days and how rainbows are still painted for you and me today.  <br /><br />Storms come and come quickly. Doubts come. Death captures the love of your life. If you are in a storm - you know what I am talking about. If you are not, this book is still for you. Events may be in your forecast and you can be prepared for the sting of the storm. The storm does pass and tomorrow can be a forecast full of sunshine, hope, faith, and promise. You can count on light to change your perspective, bring life into focus and help your goals come together just when you need it the most.  <br /><br />If this book leaves you equipped to capture some great images by utilizing lighting techniques - great. If it helps you see the beauty in your own experiences - even better. If the personal stories and thoughts encourage and challenge you to capture the moment - fantastic. If you see that having the Light in your life can leave you living a radiant life - you will have received the message of the book.

    [vfb-13] => http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N3JHT71
    [vfb-22] => Nonfiction
    [vfb-17] => This book is compiled with text, quotes and more than 50 professional photography images. Without light there is complete darkness. Light is the most important tool to a photographer but we also need Light in our lives in order to live radiant lives. The book is compiled into 3 sections. Seeing the Beauty. Capturing the Moment. Sharing the Light.  <br /><br />SECTION 1 SEEING THE BEAUTY <br />Using a nature theme of flowers, wildlife and landscapes, natural lighting is discussed along with beauty in our surroundings and from within. The author shares how her family saw the beauty in old granaries to make a beautiful home. She also earned to live a radiant life though she faced many struggles as a child from adoption, poor vision, dyslexia, being left-handed, speech difficulties etc.  <br /><br />SECTION 2 CAPTURING THE MOMENT uses a tropical theme of waves, trees and oceanscapes. Showing how to paint with light is then paralleled with life experiences and the importance of how words impacted a broken teenager and gave her the confidence to soar. The challenges of being adopted are discussed. If you have ever adopted a pet you will also appreciate this section.  <br /><br />SECTION 3 SHARING THE LIGHT is the final section of the book and scenes from sunrise, sunset and black and white shots are shared. Flash lighting is the theme because of it\'s speed. The author then shares personal stories of her brother\'s final days and how rainbows are still painted for you and me today.  <br /><br />Storms come and come quickly. Doubts come. Death captures the love of your life. If you are in a storm - you know what I am talking about. If you are not, this book is still for you. Events may be in your forecast and you can be prepared for the sting of the storm. The storm does pass and tomorrow can be a forecast full of sunshine, hope, faith, and promise. You can count on light to change your perspective, bring life into focus and help your goals come together just when you need it the most.  <br /><br />If this book leaves you equipped to capture some great images by utilizing lighting techniques - great. If it helps you see the beauty in your own experiences - even better. If the personal stories and thoughts encourage and challenge you to capture the moment - fantastic. If you see that having the Light in your life can leave you living a radiant life - you will have received the message of the book.

    [vfb-13] => http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N3JHT71
    [vfb-22] => Nonfiction
    [vfb-17] => This book is compiled with text, quotes and more than 50 professional photography images. Without light there is complete darkness. Light is the most important tool to a photographer but we also need Light in our lives in order to live radiant lives. The book is compiled into 3 sections. Seeing the Beauty. Capturing the Moment. Sharing the Light.  <br /><br />SECTION 1 SEEING THE BEAUTY <br />Using a nature theme of flowers, wildlife and landscapes, natural lighting is discussed along with beauty in our surroundings and from within. The author shares how her family saw the beauty in old granaries to make a beautiful home. She also earned to live a radiant life though she faced many struggles as a child from adoption, poor vision, dyslexia, being left-handed, speech difficulties etc.  <br /><br />SECTION 2 CAPTURING THE MOMENT uses a tropical theme of waves, trees and oceanscapes. Showing how to paint with light is then paralleled with life experiences and the importance of how words impacted a broken teenager and gave her the confidence to soar. The challenges of being adopted are discussed. If you have ever adopted a pet you will also appreciate this section.  <br /><br />SECTION 3 SHARING THE LIGHT is the final section of the book and scenes from sunrise, sunset and black and white shots are shared. Flash lighting is the theme because of it\'s speed. The author then shares personal stories of her brother\'s final days and how rainbows are still painted for you and me today.  <br /><br />Storms come and come quickly. Doubts come. Death captures the love of your life. If you are in a storm - you know what I am talking about. If you are not, this book is still for you. Events may be in your forecast and you can be prepared for the sting of the storm. The storm does pass and tomorrow can be a forecast full of sunshine, hope, faith, and promise. You can count on light to change your perspective, bring life into focus and help your goals come together just when you need it the most.  <br /><br />If this book leaves you equipped to capture some great images by utilizing lighting techniques - great. If it helps you see the beauty in your own experiences - even better. If the personal stories and thoughts encourage and challenge you to capture the moment - fantastic. If you see that having the Light in your life can leave you living a radiant life - you will have received the message of the book.

    [vfb-13] => http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N3JHT71
    [vfb-22] => Nonfiction
    [vfb-17] => This book is compiled with text, quotes and more than 50 professional photography images. Without light there is complete darkness. Light is the most important tool to a photographer but we also need Light in our lives in order to live radiant lives. The book is compiled into 3 sections. Seeing the Beauty. Capturing the Moment. Sharing the Light.  <br /><br />SECTION 1 SEEING THE BEAUTY <br />Using a nature theme of flowers, wildlife and landscapes, natural lighting is discussed along with beauty in our surroundings and from within. The author shares how her family saw the beauty in old granaries to make a beautiful home. She also earned to live a radiant life though she faced many struggles as a child from adoption, poor vision, dyslexia, being left-handed, speech difficulties etc.  <br /><br />SECTION 2 CAPTURING THE MOMENT uses a tropical theme of waves, trees and oceanscapes. Showing how to paint with light is then paralleled with life experiences and the importance of how words impacted a broken teenager and gave her the confidence to soar. The challenges of being adopted are discussed. If you have ever adopted a pet you will also appreciate this section.  <br /><br />SECTION 3 SHARING THE LIGHT is the final section of the book and scenes from sunrise, sunset and black and white shots are shared. Flash lighting is the theme because of it\'s speed. The author then shares personal stories of her brother\'s final days and how rainbows are still painted for you and me today.  <br /><br />Storms come and come quickly. Doubts come. Death captures the love of your life. If you are in a storm - you know what I am talking about. If you are not, this book is still for you. Events may be in your forecast and you can be prepared for the sting of the storm. The storm does pass and tomorrow can be a forecast full of sunshine, hope, faith, and promise. You can count on light to change your perspective, bring life into focus and help your goals come together just when you need it the most.  <br /><br />If this book leaves you equipped to capture some great images by utilizing lighting techniques - great. If it helps you see the beauty in your own experiences - even better. If the personal stories and thoughts encourage and challenge you to capture the moment - fantastic. If you see that having the Light in your life can leave you living a radiant life - you will have received the message of the book.

    [vfb-22] => Nonfiction
    [vfb-17] => This book is compiled with text, quotes and more than 50 professional photography images. Without light there is complete darkness. Light is the most important tool to a photographer but we also need Light in our lives in order to live radiant lives. The book is compiled into 3 sections. Seeing the Beauty. Capturing the Moment. Sharing the Light.  <br /><br />SECTION 1 SEEING THE BEAUTY <br />Using a nature theme of flowers, wildlife and landscapes, natural lighting is discussed along with beauty in our surroundings and from within. The author shares how her family saw the beauty in old granaries to make a beautiful home. She also earned to live a radiant life though she faced many struggles as a child from adoption, poor vision, dyslexia, being left-handed, speech difficulties etc.  <br /><br />SECTION 2 CAPTURING THE MOMENT uses a tropical theme of waves, trees and oceanscapes. Showing how to paint with light is then paralleled with life experiences and the importance of how words impacted a broken teenager and gave her the confidence to soar. The challenges of being adopted are discussed. If you have ever adopted a pet you will also appreciate this section.  <br /><br />SECTION 3 SHARING THE LIGHT is the final section of the book and scenes from sunrise, sunset and black and white shots are shared. Flash lighting is the theme because of it\'s speed. The author then shares personal stories of her brother\'s final days and how rainbows are still painted for you and me today.  <br /><br />Storms come and come quickly. Doubts come. Death captures the love of your life. If you are in a storm - you know what I am talking about. If you are not, this book is still for you. Events may be in your forecast and you can be prepared for the sting of the storm. The storm does pass and tomorrow can be a forecast full of sunshine, hope, faith, and promise. You can count on light to change your perspective, bring life into focus and help your goals come together just when you need it the most.  <br /><br />If this book leaves you equipped to capture some great images by utilizing lighting techniques - great. If it helps you see the beauty in your own experiences - even better. If the personal stories and thoughts encourage and challenge you to capture the moment - fantastic. If you see that having the Light in your life can leave you living a radiant life - you will have received the message of the book.

She also earned to live a radiant life though she faced many struggles as a child from adoption, poor vision, dyslexia, being left-handed, speech difficulties etc.  <br /><br />SECTION 2 CAPTURING THE MOMENT uses a tropical theme of waves, trees and oceanscapes. Showing how to paint with light is then paralleled with life experiences and the importance of how words impacted a broken teenager and gave her the confidence to soar. The challenges of being adopted are discussed. If you have ever adopted a pet you will also appreciate this section.  <br /><br />SECTION 3 SHARING THE LIGHT is the final section of the book and scenes from sunrise, sunset and black and white shots are shared. Flash lighting is the theme because of it\'s speed. The author then shares personal stories of her brother\'s final days and how rainbows are still painted for you and me today.  <br /><br />Storms come and come quickly. Doubts come. Death captures the love of your life. If you are in a storm - you know what I am talking about. If you are not, this book is still for you. Events may be in your forecast and you can be prepared for the sting of the storm. The storm does pass and tomorrow can be a forecast full of sunshine, hope, faith, and promise. You can count on light to change your perspective, bring life into focus and help your goals come together just when you need it the most.  <br /><br />If this book leaves you equipped to capture some great images by utilizing lighting techniques - great. If it helps you see the beauty in your own experiences - even better. If the personal stories and thoughts encourage and challenge you to capture the moment - fantastic. If you see that having the Light in your life can leave you living a radiant life - you will have received the message of the book.

    [vfb-13] => http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N3JHT71
    [vfb-22] => Nonfiction
    [vfb-17] => This book is compiled with text, quotes and more than 50 professional photography images. Without light there is complete darkness. Light is the most important tool to a photographer but we also need Light in our lives in order to live radiant lives. The book is compiled into 3 sections. Seeing the Beauty. Capturing the Moment. Sharing the Light.  <br /><br />SECTION 1 SEEING THE BEAUTY <br />Using a nature theme of flowers, wildlife and landscapes, natural lighting is discussed along with beauty in our surroundings and from within. The author shares how her family saw the beauty in old granaries to make a beautiful home. She also earned to live a radiant life though she faced many struggles as a child from adoption, poor vision, dyslexia, being left-handed, speech difficulties etc.  <br /><br />SECTION 2 CAPTURING THE MOMENT uses a tropical theme of waves, trees and oceanscapes. Showing how to paint with light is then paralleled with life experiences and the importance of how words impacted a broken teenager and gave her the confidence to soar. The challenges of being adopted are discussed. If you have ever adopted a pet you will also appreciate this section.  <br /><br />SECTION 3 SHARING THE LIGHT is the final section of the book and scenes from sunrise, sunset and black and white shots are shared. Flash lighting is the theme because of it\'s speed. The author then shares personal stories of her brother\'s final days and how rainbows are still painted for you and me today.  <br /><br />Storms come and come quickly. Doubts come. Death captures the love of your life. If you are in a storm - you know what I am talking about. If you are not, this book is still for you. Events may be in your forecast and you can be prepared for the sting of the storm. The storm does pass and tomorrow can be a forecast full of sunshine, hope, faith, and promise. You can count on light to change your perspective, bring life into focus and help your goals come together just when you need it the most.  <br /><br />If this book leaves you equipped to capture some great images by utilizing lighting techniques - great. If it helps you see the beauty in your own experiences - even better. If the personal stories and thoughts encourage and challenge you to capture the moment - fantastic. If you see that having the Light in your life can leave you living a radiant life - you will have received the message of the book.

Docked onto the hull of his sub was the new, state-of-the-art Advanced SEAL Delivery System, complete with 16 highly trained SEALs. Orders from the White House were simple, yet clear. Penetrate the Bo Hai Bay--a mere hundred miles from Beijing--and linger while the SEALS conduct nighttime missions. Simple, as long as they weren\'t detected. But if spotted inside the shallow bay, the orders were clear. McGraw couldn\'t let the Charlotte or the ASDS fall into Chinese hands, even if it meant destroying both.

Penetrate the Bo Hai Bay--a mere hundred miles from Beijing--and linger while the SEALS conduct nighttime missions. Simple, as long as they weren\'t detected. But if spotted inside the shallow bay, the orders were clear. McGraw couldn\'t let the Charlotte or the ASDS fall into Chinese hands, even if it meant destroying both.
    [input_8] => Hello fellow patriots and adventure seekers. I started writing the first book in the Die-Hard Patriots Series in the winter of 2000, when winter weather forced me to take a break from farming grass seed here in Western Oregon. It took twelve arduous years and a half-dozen versions before Time Bomb Ticking was published in December of 2012. As a political junkie, I created Time Bomb Ticking and Choosing Sides to reflect current events, including our burgeoning nation debt and the danger it poses to our republic and personal liberties. The sequel to Choosing Sides is scheduled to be released in the fall of 2016 and will take the reader on an epic journey across the globe as they follow Cal Stockton and his band of brothers in the air and under the sea—but most importantly—into a future filled with risk.

    [description] => Espionage was nothing new to Captain Larry McGraw and the crew of the USS Charlotte, a Los Angeles--class fast attack submarine. But this mission certainly was. Docked onto the hull of his sub was the new, state-of-the-art Advanced SEAL Delivery System, complete with 16 highly trained SEALs. Orders from the White House were simple, yet clear. Penetrate the Bo Hai Bay--a mere hundred miles from Beijing--and linger while the SEALS conduct nighttime missions. Simple, as long as they weren\'t detected. But if spotted inside the shallow bay, the orders were clear. McGraw couldn\'t let the Charlotte or the ASDS fall into Chinese hands, even if it meant destroying both.

    [field-a6c77a955d5407a] => Espionage was nothing new to Captain Larry McGraw and the crew of the USS Charlotte, a Los Angeles--class fast attack submarine. But this mission certainly was. Docked onto the hull of his sub was the new, state-of-the-art Advanced SEAL Delivery System, complete with 16 highly trained SEALs. Orders from the White House were simple, yet clear. Penetrate the Bo Hai Bay--a mere hundred miles from Beijing--and linger while the SEALS conduct nighttime missions. Simple, as long as they weren\'t detected. But if spotted inside the shallow bay, the orders were clear. McGraw couldn\'t let the Charlotte or the ASDS fall into Chinese hands, even if it meant destroying both.

    [input_8] => Hello fellow patriots and adventure seekers. I started writing the first book in the Die-Hard Patriots Series in the winter of 2000, when winter weather forced me to take a break from farming grass seed here in Western Oregon. It took twelve arduous years and a half-dozen versions before Time Bomb Ticking was published in December of 2012. As a political junkie, I created Time Bomb Ticking and Choosing Sides to reflect current events, including our burgeoning nation debt and the danger it poses to our republic and personal liberties. The sequel to Choosing Sides is scheduled to be released in the fall of 2016 and will take the reader on an epic journey across the globe as they follow Cal Stockton and his band of brothers in the air and under the sea—but most importantly—into a future filled with risk.

    [input_2] => Espionage was nothing new to Captain Larry McGraw and the crew of the USS Charlotte, a Los Angeles--class fast attack submarine. But this mission certainly was. Docked onto the hull of his sub was the new, state-of-the-art Advanced SEAL Delivery System, complete with 16 highly trained SEALs. Orders from the White House were simple, yet clear. Penetrate the Bo Hai Bay--a mere hundred miles from Beijing--and linger while the SEALS conduct nighttime missions. Simple, as long as they weren\'t detected. But if spotted inside the shallow bay, the orders were clear. McGraw couldn\'t let the Charlotte or the ASDS fall into Chinese hands, even if it meant destroying both.
    [input_8] => Hello fellow patriots and adventure seekers. I started writing the first book in the Die-Hard Patriots Series in the winter of 2000, when winter weather forced me to take a break from farming grass seed here in Western Oregon. It took twelve arduous years and a half-dozen versions before Time Bomb Ticking was published in December of 2012. As a political junkie, I created Time Bomb Ticking and Choosing Sides to reflect current events, including our burgeoning nation debt and the danger it poses to our republic and personal liberties. The sequel to Choosing Sides is scheduled to be released in the fall of 2016 and will take the reader on an epic journey across the globe as they follow Cal Stockton and his band of brothers in the air and under the sea—but most importantly—into a future filled with risk.

Docked onto the hull of his sub was the new, state-of-the-art Advanced SEAL Delivery System, complete with 16 highly trained SEALs. Orders from the White House were simple, yet clear. Penetrate the Bo Hai Bay--a mere hundred miles from Beijing--and linger while the SEALS conduct nighttime missions. Simple, as long as they weren\'t detected. But if spotted inside the shallow bay, the orders were clear. McGraw couldn\'t let the Charlotte or the ASDS fall into Chinese hands, even if it meant destroying both.

This masterpiece exemplifies what fans around the world have grown to love about iStayWoke which is the perfect mixture of passion to inspire, piquancy to inform and entertain, with a hint of pollyannaism for comfort.   “What will I leave behind when I leave this Earth?” or “Is this all that life has to offer?” (Pick a question)  iStayWoke has utilized years of research and experience to elegantly design a system of stories centered on a protagonist named Malcolm who is forced to answer this question. The reader is given the opportunity to simultaneously walk alongside Malcolm through his test and trials in pursuit of answers and unite the puzzle pieces of a much larger grand scheme.   Will Malcolm avoid the generational curse of monotonous losing? Or will he transcend mediocrity and even death itself? Which road are you headed toward?   This innovative and revolutionary guidebook introduces simplistic and life-altering truths such as:  • The criminal that has been killing you softly • Why you are blind to success • How to finally get that promotion • What in your environment that has been holding you back • And much more!

    [book_title] => How To Cheat Death: Nine Keys to Overcoming a Dead Broke Mentality
    [synopsis] => iStayWoke, an internationally recognized personal development company, reveals that the key to transcending the “average mentality” is as simple as adopting nine essential concepts. This masterpiece exemplifies what fans around the world have grown to love about iStayWoke which is the perfect mixture of passion to inspire, piquancy to inform and entertain, with a hint of pollyannaism for comfort.   “What will I leave behind when I leave this Earth?” or “Is this all that life has to offer?” (Pick a question)  iStayWoke has utilized years of research and experience to elegantly design a system of stories centered on a protagonist named Malcolm who is forced to answer this question. The reader is given the opportunity to simultaneously walk alongside Malcolm through his test and trials in pursuit of answers and unite the puzzle pieces of a much larger grand scheme.   Will Malcolm avoid the generational curse of monotonous losing? Or will he transcend mediocrity and even death itself? Which road are you headed toward?   This innovative and revolutionary guidebook introduces simplistic and life-altering truths such as:  • The criminal that has been killing you softly • Why you are blind to success • How to finally get that promotion • What in your environment that has been holding you back • And much more!

    [ninja_forms_field_17] => Divorce is such an ugly word! It means the death of a marriage, lost dreams, heartache, broken promises. It means families are torn apart, hearts are shattered, and you are now alone. It means that you didn\'t get your happily ever after.  Millions of questions run through your head such as who am I now, where do I go from here, how will my children make it through, what about my finances, and more often than not, the question of \'how did I get here\'? I\'ve been there...more than once. I know the pain, heartache, and turmoil divorce causes us. I also know now, that if we don\'t take the time to heal and I mean truly heal our hearts, we will make the same mistakes. That\'s what I did. I listened to the world\'s voice of \'Get back out there! Get back on the horse!\' I ended up with a lot of heart ache and feeling empty. Years before I had turned a deaf ear to God\'s voice because I didn\'t feel I was worthy of His grace, mercy, or love. One day I cried out to Him for help and He answered me! From that day forward I began rebuilding my relationship with Father God and the healing began! It is true that God hates divorce. He hates it because of what it does to our hearts, minds, bodies, and families. The destruction is devastating. But God...that phrase is the key...but God! He has a plan of healing for you! He is faithful to restore and renew too, if we just let Him. He still has a wonderful destiny for your life, it hasn\'t changed...it is still waiting for you if you are ready to let Him come along side you and help you! The information in this book has helped many just like you, men and women, young and old. I encourage you to take your first step toward the healing your heart needs and move into your destiny today!

    [entry_1000013] => Divorce is such an ugly word! It means the death of a marriage, lost dreams, heartache, broken promises. It means families are torn apart, hearts are shattered, and you are now alone. It means that you didn\'t get your happily ever after.  Millions of questions run through your head such as who am I now, where do I go from here, how will my children make it through, what about my finances, and more often than not, the question of \'how did I get here\'? I\'ve been there...more than once. I know the pain, heartache, and turmoil divorce causes us. I also know now, that if we don\'t take the time to heal and I mean truly heal our hearts, we will make the same mistakes. That\'s what I did. I listened to the world\'s voice of \'Get back out there! Get back on the horse!\' I ended up with a lot of heart ache and feeling empty. Years before I had turned a deaf ear to God\'s voice because I didn\'t feel I was worthy of His grace, mercy, or love. One day I cried out to Him for help and He answered me! From that day forward I began rebuilding my relationship with Father God and the healing began! It is true that God hates divorce. He hates it because of what it does to our hearts, minds, bodies, and families. The destruction is devastating. But God...that phrase is the key...but God! He has a plan of healing for you! He is faithful to restore and renew too, if we just let Him. He still has a wonderful destiny for your life, it hasn\'t changed...it is still waiting for you if you are ready to let Him come along side you and help you! The information in this book has helped many just like you, men and women, young and old. I encourage you to take your first step toward the healing your heart needs and move into your destiny today!

    [book_title] => Destiny After Divorce: Navigating The Path To Your Bright Future!
    [synopsis] => Divorce is such an ugly word! It means the death of a marriage, lost dreams, heartache, broken promises. It means families are torn apart, hearts are shattered, and you are now alone. It means that you didn\'t get your happily ever after.  Millions of questions run through your head such as who am I now, where do I go from here, how will my children make it through, what about my finances, and more often than not, the question of \'how did I get here\'? I\'ve been there...more than once. I know the pain, heartache, and turmoil divorce causes us. I also know now, that if we don\'t take the time to heal and I mean truly heal our hearts, we will make the same mistakes. That\'s what I did. I listened to the world\'s voice of \'Get back out there! Get back on the horse!\' I ended up with a lot of heart ache and feeling empty. Years before I had turned a deaf ear to God\'s voice because I didn\'t feel I was worthy of His grace, mercy, or love. One day I cried out to Him for help and He answered me! From that day forward I began rebuilding my relationship with Father God and the healing began! It is true that God hates divorce. He hates it because of what it does to our hearts, minds, bodies, and families. The destruction is devastating. But God...that phrase is the key...but God! He has a plan of healing for you! He is faithful to restore and renew too, if we just let Him. He still has a wonderful destiny for your life, it hasn\'t changed...it is still waiting for you if you are ready to let Him come along side you and help you! The information in this book has helped many just like you, men and women, young and old. I encourage you to take your first step toward the healing your heart needs and move into your destiny today!

    [vfb-5] => Destiny After Divorce: Navigating The Path To Your Bright Future!
    [vfb-13] => http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01NBIIJGL
    [vfb-22] => Nonfiction
    [vfb-17] => Divorce is such an ugly word! It means the death of a marriage, lost dreams, heartache, broken promises. It means families are torn apart, hearts are shattered, and you are now alone. It means that you didn\'t get your happily ever after.  Millions of questions run through your head such as who am I now, where do I go from here, how will my children make it through, what about my finances, and more often than not, the question of \'how did I get here\'? I\'ve been there...more than once. I know the pain, heartache, and turmoil divorce causes us. I also know now, that if we don\'t take the time to heal and I mean truly heal our hearts, we will make the same mistakes. That\'s what I did. I listened to the world\'s voice of \'Get back out there! Get back on the horse!\' I ended up with a lot of heart ache and feeling empty. Years before I had turned a deaf ear to God\'s voice because I didn\'t feel I was worthy of His grace, mercy, or love. One day I cried out to Him for help and He answered me! From that day forward I began rebuilding my relationship with Father God and the healing began! It is true that God hates divorce. He hates it because of what it does to our hearts, minds, bodies, and families. The destruction is devastating. But God...that phrase is the key...but God! He has a plan of healing for you! He is faithful to restore and renew too, if we just let Him. He still has a wonderful destiny for your life, it hasn\'t changed...it is still waiting for you if you are ready to let Him come along side you and help you! The information in this book has helped many just like you, men and women, young and old. I encourage you to take your first step toward the healing your heart needs and move into your destiny today!

In order to get them, we must make the first step. <br /><br />To figure out how to overcome difficulties that may appear on our path, we only must proceed with the certainty that we will achieve what we proposed and believe that we\'ll get it and that any obstacle or mental cluster will be overcome with our faith. <br /><br />The race of life is to know how to run it and to be focused on the goal. It will teach you how to deal with the trials when tiredness and pain surround you. You may change your steps or pace but never your vision toward your goals or dreams. You may take a pause to refresh yourself, to catch up your breath, or to deeply remove habits that may be burdens or obstacles that hold you from advancing. <br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Todos somos corredores en la vida. <br /><br />Todos tenemos metas que alcanzar, pueden ser un negocio, un trabajo, una carrera universitaria, encontrar la pareja correcta para formar un hogar, al cansar un nivel economico y social, entre otras metas. De manera que para llegar a obtenerlas tenemos que dar el primer paso. <br /><br />Saber vencer las dificultades que se encuentran a nuestro paso, tenemos que avanzar solo con la certeza de que lograremos lo que nos proponemos y creer que llegaremos; entonces cualquier obstAculo o barrera mental se sobre pasa con nuestra fe. <br /><br />La a carrera de la vida hay que saber como correrla, es permanecer enfocado en la meta, eso te enseNara como tratar las dificultades en el trayecto cuando el cansancio y el dolor te agobie. Puedes cambiar el paso o el ritmo pero nunca tu vision a tus metas o suenos. Puedes hacer una pausa para refrescarte, respirar profundamente, despojarte de habitos arraigados que te sean carga u obstAculos que no te dejen avanzar.

Here I have hybridized this medical technique normally used for complex diagnoses with my work in research and business leadership to create seven antidotes to decision procrastination—a framework, entitled Decision Diagnosis, which we can apply to decision-making.  <br /><br />I believe that when you apply this framework, it will provide useful insights. Most importantly of all, it will help you achieve a greater understanding, clarity, and focus in your strategy and decision-making. Whether it is for personal or professional decisions, I believe this construct will help you succeed and improve your strategic and executive function.

OR SO I THOUGHT.
In the midst of tragedy, we feel hopeless.  We are surrounded by darkness and despair.  It’s not that we lack power; it’s that we lack the awareness of it and we lack the belief in it. When we tap into our personal power, we learn to become resilient. And soon, we become completely unfazed by the very same things that would have previously forced us to our knees. Over time, I was able to overcome that fear and reclaim my power. It is my hope that, through this book, you are inspired to reclaim your power as well.

    [input_1] => Punk Azz Cancer, How Dare You! How To Turn Your Pain Into Power After A Cancer Diagnosis by Brianne Joseph
    [input_2] => In many communities, a \"punk\" is someone who sneaks up on you and attacks you when you least expect it. Cancer is definitely a punk.  I was shocked and embarrassed with my breast cancer diagnosis. How could I be fabulous with breast cancer? Right?  Where’s the power in being sick? For a while, I lived in a darkness so thick I could touch it. Breast cancer introduced me to a level of fear I never imagined I would ever experience.  I became depressed and reclusive. I felt devastated, defeated, and at times inconsolable. I hardly recognized the frightened woman in the mirror. She was not me. I could handle anything. Couldn’t I? It was difficult to accept her as the new me - a broken me, a terrified me. I guess I wasn’t that brave after all……..OR SO I THOUGHT.In the midst of tragedy, we feel hopeless.  We are surrounded by darkness and despair.  It’s not that we lack power; it’s that we lack the awareness of it and we lack the belief in it. When we tap into our personal power, we learn to become resilient. And soon, we become completely unfazed by the very same things that would have previously forced us to our knees. Over time, I was able to overcome that fear and reclaim my power. It is my hope that, through this book, you are inspired to reclaim your power as well. My dark days gave me a story,  they didn’t make me powerful. I was already powerful- so are you. Believe it.
    [input_8] => Award-winning entrepreneur, author, and speaker Brianne Joseph shares her heartwarming and inspirational story of personal triumph over breast cancer. She outlines her journey from depression to ultimately turning her pain into power as a guide for other survivors to reclaim their power as well. In this refreshingly spirited book, audiences are sure to drink up her words of hope, wisdom, spunk, and attitude.

    [description] => In many communities, a \"punk\" is someone who sneaks up on you and attacks you when you least expect it. Cancer is definitely a punk.  I was shocked and embarrassed with my breast cancer diagnosis. How could I be fabulous with breast cancer? Right?  Where’s the power in being sick?

OR SO I THOUGHT.
In the midst of tragedy, we feel hopeless.  We are surrounded by darkness and despair.  It’s not that we lack power; it’s that we lack the awareness of it and we lack the belief in it. When we tap into our personal power, we learn to become resilient. And soon, we become completely unfazed by the very same things that would have previously forced us to our knees. Over time, I was able to overcome that fear and reclaim my power. It is my hope that, through this book, you are inspired to reclaim your power as well. My dark days gave me a story,  they didn’t make me powerful. I was already powerful- so are you. 
Believe it.

    [synopsis] => In many communities, a \"punk\" is someone who sneaks up on you and attacks you when you least expect it. Cancer is definitely a punk.  I was shocked and embarrassed with my breast cancer diagnosis. How could I be fabulous with breast cancer? Right?  Where’s the power in being sick? For a while, I lived in a darkness so thick I could touch it. Breast cancer introduced me to a level of fear I never imagined I would ever experience.  I became depressed and reclusive. I felt devastated, defeated, and at times inconsolable. I hardly recognized the frightened woman in the mirror. She was not me. I could handle anything. Couldn’t I? It was difficult to accept her as the new me - a broken me, a terrified me. I guess I wasn’t that brave after all……..OR SO I THOUGHT.In the midst of tragedy, we feel hopeless.  We are surrounded by darkness and despair.  It’s not that we lack power; it’s that we lack the awareness of it and we lack the belief in it. When we tap into our personal power, we learn to become resilient. And soon, we become completely unfazed by the very same things that would have previously forced us to our knees. Over time, I was able to overcome that fear and reclaim my power. It is my hope that, through this book, you are inspired to reclaim your power as well. My dark days gave me a story,  they didn’t make me powerful. I was already powerful- so are you. Believe it.

I was shocked and embarrassed with my breast cancer diagnosis. How could I be fabulous with breast cancer? Right?  Where’s the power in being sick? For a while, I lived in a darkness so thick I could touch it. Breast cancer introduced me to a level of fear I never imagined I would ever experience.  I became depressed and reclusive. I felt devastated, defeated, and at times inconsolable. I hardly recognized the frightened woman in the mirror. She was not me. I could handle anything. Couldn’t I? It was difficult to accept her as the new me - a broken me, a terrified me. I guess I wasn’t that brave after all……..OR SO I THOUGHT.In the midst of tragedy, we feel hopeless.  We are surrounded by darkness and despair.  It’s not that we lack power; it’s that we lack the awareness of it and we lack the belief in it. When we tap into our personal power, we learn to become resilient. And soon, we become completely unfazed by the very same things that would have previously forced us to our knees. Over time, I was able to overcome that fear and reclaim my power. It is my hope that, through this book, you are inspired to reclaim your power as well. My dark days gave me a story,  they didn’t make me powerful. I was already powerful- so are you. Believe it.

For a while, I lived in a darkness so thick I could touch it. Breast cancer introduced me to a level of fear I never imagined I would ever experience.  I became depressed and reclusive. I felt devastated, defeated, and at times inconsolable. I hardly recognized the frightened woman in the mirror. She was not me. I could handle anything. Couldn’t I? It was difficult to accept her as the new me - a broken me, a terrified me. I guess I wasn’t that brave after all……..OR SO I THOUGHT.In the midst of tragedy, we feel hopeless.  We are surrounded by darkness and despair.  It’s not that we lack power; it’s that we lack the awareness of it and we lack the belief in it. When we tap into our personal power, we learn to become resilient. And soon, we become completely unfazed by the very same things that would have previously forced us to our knees. Over time, I was able to overcome that fear and reclaim my power. It is my hope that, through this book, you are inspired to reclaim your power as well. My dark days gave me a story,  they didn’t make me powerful. I was already powerful- so are you. Believe it.

How do successful companies create software systems that people love? Why do some software projects capture full business value while others flop? Is there a pattern underlying how successful managers hook into their team\'s excellence? What makes software teams engage with certain projects in a way that surprises and delights everyone?
Roland Racko answers these questions (and many more) by explaining how \"management by query\" - a 12-step process during the software development process - subtly encourages positive team behavior. This book shows you, the non-technical executive, start-up founder or manager (someone having approval control over software development), a new way to corral the software development process in a manner that enhances the business value of the product and the project.

    [description] => [This book is a recent Amazon #1 Hot New Release Award]
How do successful companies create software systems that people love? 
Why do some software projects capture full business value while others flop? Is there a pattern underlying how successful managers hook into their team\'s excellence? What makes software teams engage with certain projects in a way that surprises and delights everyone?
Roland Racko answers these questions (and many more) by explaining how \"management by query\" - a 12-step process during the software development process - subtly encourages positive team behavior. This book shows you, the non-technical executive, start-up founder or manager (someone having approval control over software development), a new way to corral the software development process in a manner that enhances the business value of the product and the project.
How? By building on insights you already possess: life experience. Those insights have always been part of your experience, even though that experience, has been mostly, if not entirely, non-technical. The book conceptually divides the assertion of executive influence into 12 steps, each of which is strategically-timed. Each step draws on those life insights.You are not simply reading a handbook on how a largely non-technical executive can successfully manage software teams using strategic timing, but you are also about to learn how to re-purpose your best personal insights to achieve maximum business value from your project.
\"Timing Is Almost Everything\" is based on Racko’s years of consulting, research, and practical experience. He wrote the book he wished had been available to him as a start-up consultant—not abstract theory, but a how-to guide for building better software systems. \"Timing Is Almost Everything\" is written for start-up founders, product managers, designers, and anyone who seeks to understand how to coax the very best from software teams.
Racko provides readers with:
• Actionable steps for building software systems that deliver the maximum business value.
• Practical guides to creating positive team habits that stick.

This book shows you, the non-technical executive, start-up founder or manager (someone having approval control over software development), a new way to corral the software development process in a manner that enhances the business value of the product and the project.  How?  By building on insights you already possess: life experience. Those insights have always been part of your experience, even though that experience, has been mostly, if not entirely, non-technical. The book conceptually divides the assertion of executive influence in 12 steps, each of which is strategically-timed. Each step draws on those life insights.  You are not simply reading a handbook on how a largely non-technical executive can successfully manage software teams using strategic timing, but you are also about to learn how to re-purpose your best personal insights to achieve maximum business value from your project.  \"Timing Is Almost Everything\" is based on Racko’s years of consulting, research, and practical experience. He wrote the book he wished had been available to him as a start-up consultant—not abstract theory, but a how-to guide for building better software systems. \"Timing Is Almost Everything\" is written for start-up founders, product managers, designers, and anyone who seeks to understand how to coax the very best from software teams.  Racko provides readers with: • Actionable steps for building software systems that deliver the maximum business value. • Practical guides to creating positive team habits that stick.

We thought so too! Bankroll Your Mind is more than just a sexy abstraction aimed at getting you going and getting more done. We designed Bankroll Your Mind to help you master your mindset, develop the attitude for success, and ramp up performance to get the results you want <br />and deserve.  <br /><br />You will gain complete clarity with what you want, achieve laser focus on your one true goal, and act with intention and precision creating meaningful results through mastery so you can ultimately take total control of your business and your life.  <br /><br />You will also discover how to operate with total integrity, to be the best in whatever you do and give the absolute best to your clients. Your new attitude will allow you to take personal responsibility and control of your thoughts, behaviors, and emotions so that you will become the driver in your life. You will also learn to recognize when opportunities present themselves and take initiative. You will learn the power of saying yes and when to say no. The days of paralysis by analysis will soon be over. You will realize that it is more than just mindset. You are more than just a person to be motivated. You are your body, your mind, your spirit, and your shadow. Every part of you deserves to be fed and exercised and we will show you how to tetra-evolve. It is time to Bankroll Your Mind!

He saw that there was great power in collaboration.

We thought so too! Bankroll Your Mind is more than just a sexy abstraction aimed at getting you going and getting more done. We designed Bankroll Your Mind to help you master your mindset, develop the attitude for success, and ramp up performance to get the results you want <br />and deserve.  <br /><br />You will gain complete clarity with what you want, achieve laser focus on your one true goal, and act with intention and precision creating meaningful results through mastery so you can ultimately take total control of your business and your life.  <br /><br />You will also discover how to operate with total integrity, to be the best in whatever you do and give the absolute best to your clients. Your new attitude will allow you to take personal responsibility and control of your thoughts, behaviors, and emotions so that you will become the driver in your life. You will also learn to recognize when opportunities present themselves and take initiative. You will learn the power of saying yes and when to say no.

Most women believe that they must sacrifice their dreams to be a good mother, or sacrifice their families to succeed professionally. Not true. You can have both.  <br /><br />I’m Calling You Out! If you’re a Mom, and you feel you were put on this Earth for a special purpose, I’m calling you out. Happy, fulfilled moms create happy families. Show your kids how to follow their dreams by following your own. <br /><br />Find Time For it All. In this book I show you how to fulfill your dreams no matter how crazy they are, and be an example for your kids. I have worked with artists, business owners, healers, TV producers, and others who now enjoy plenty of time for their kids, their partner, themselves and their calling. <br /><br />Get Pregnant Now. If you struggle to conceive, or have unexplained infertility, read Chapter 8. There is always an explainable reason that blocks your fertility. Discover why there is hope, and how you can become a mom, too. <br /><br />Let this book inspire you to experience every drop of motherhood and follow your dream at the same time.

Most women believe that they must sacrifice their dreams to be a good mother, or sacrifice their families to succeed professionally. Not true. You can have both.  I’m Calling You Out! If you’re a Mom, and you feel you were put on this Earth for a special purpose, I’m calling you out. Happy, fulfilled moms create happy families. Show your kids how to follow their dreams by following your own. Find Time For it All. In this book I show you how to fulfill your dreams no matter how crazy they are, and be an example for your kids. I have worked with artists, business owners, healers, TV producers, and others who now enjoy plenty of time for their kids, their partner, themselves and their calling. Get Pregnant Now. If you struggle to conceive, or have unexplained infertility, read Chapter 8. There is always an explainable reason that blocks your fertility.

If you’re a Mom, and you feel you were put on this Earth for a special purpose, I’m calling you out. Happy, fulfilled moms create happy families. Show your kids how to follow their dreams by following your own. <br /><br />Find Time For it All. In this book I show you how to fulfill your dreams no matter how crazy they are, and be an example for your kids. I have worked with artists, business owners, healers, TV producers, and others who now enjoy plenty of time for their kids, their partner, themselves and their calling. <br /><br />Get Pregnant Now. If you struggle to conceive, or have unexplained infertility, read Chapter 8. There is always an explainable reason that blocks your fertility. Discover why there is hope, and how you can become a mom, too. <br /><br />Let this book inspire you to experience every drop of motherhood and follow your dream at the same time.

    [input_8] => Tedi Tuttle Wixom, born in the heart of the Rocky Mountains in rural Idaho, is passionate about telling true stories of tenacity that transforms her readers. She began writing letters to her oldest sisters who moved away after they married and as a family historian with a love for cooking. Her first published book, A Whisper of Springtime: Jason’s Heart Transplant Miracle is a very personal sharing of her son\'s heart transplant when infant heart transplants were pioneered at Loma Linda University Medical Center (LLUMC) with cardiologists Leonard Bailey and Steven R. Gundry at his side. As a mother of nine, she completed her B.A. in English at Brigham Young University (BYU) after writing about her fifth child\'s medical ordeal. She began writing children’s illustrated stories because she believed that the ones she read to her children were not suited to her children\'s needs and lacked colorful artwork. Having a son with a heart transplant at an early age, he was made fun of for being different--bushy eyebrows, spindly, and often ill. Thus, he inspired her award winning, Danny is Different, (Spanish and English). She believes in creativity, literacy, and writing timeless new children\'s tales. She currently resides in Utah with her husband, five children, two dogs, and her cat, Ghost.

    [synopsis] => Danny Is Different is a children\'s illustrated story for kids of all ages. Vivid art with Spanish and English words on one side make reading easy for grandparents and encourages learning a second language. It teaches values of tenacity, love, and self-worth. Bullying from the community in awkward social situations such as gossip and peer pressure ultimately are resolved as the characters overcome prejudices, at home and in the community. Danny, a little green snake born odd, becomes a champion, and centers around being unique and accepting others who may appear physically different.

    [input_8] => Tedi Tuttle Wixom, born in the heart of the Rocky Mountains in rural Idaho, is passionate about telling true stories of tenacity that transforms her readers. She began writing letters to her oldest sisters who moved away after they married and as a family historian with a love for cooking. Her first published book, A Whisper of Springtime: Jason’s Heart Transplant Miracle is a very personal sharing of her son\'s heart transplant when infant heart transplants were pioneered at Loma Linda University Medical Center (LLUMC) with cardiologists Leonard Bailey and Steven R. Gundry at his side. As a mother of nine, she completed her B.A. in English at Brigham Young University (BYU) after writing about her fifth child\'s medical ordeal. She began writing children’s illustrated stories because she believed that the ones she read to her children were not suited to her children\'s needs and lacked colorful artwork. Having a son with a heart transplant at an early age, he was made fun of for being different--bushy eyebrows, spindly, and often ill. Thus, he inspired her award winning, Danny is Different, (Spanish and English). She believes in creativity, literacy, and writing timeless new children\'s tales. She currently resides in Utah with her husband, five children, two dogs, and her cat, Ghost.

    [input_8] => John Rizvi is a Registered and Board Certified Patent Attorney, Adjunct Professor of Intellectual Property Law, recognized Ted Talker, and featured speaker on topics relating to inventing and patents.He perfected his craft at one of the most prestigious and revered patent law firms in the world - a firm that counts Bell, Edison, the Wright Brothers and Ford among its distinguished list of famous inventor clients.Instead of working directly with inventors, however, he found that his time was spent mostly in meetings with in-house lawyers of large, institutional, and corporate clients.  As such, John formed his own law firm 16 years ago so he could work directly with inventors and entrepreneurs in protecting their ideas.

Now, patent attorney John Rizvi applies a unique twist to the lessons Napoleon Hill offered to millions of would-be entrepreneurs, making them relevant to inventors and innovators of all stripes. John has helped hundreds of inventors in realizing their dreams, from modest success stories to clients who sold their intellectual property for hundreds of millions of dollars.<br /><br /><i>Think and Grow Rich for Inventors</i> is the distilled essence of John\'s experience over nearly two decades of directly and personally guiding inventors through the often frustrating process of obtaining a patent in the US and abroad while working to understand the deeper passions that dive them. He brings a personal touch to the ideas Napoleon Hill codified, describing his own experiences with these principles in unflinching, often humorous, sometimes self-mocking, always thought-provoking terms.<br /><br /><i>Think and Grow Rich for Inventors</i> is geared specifically toward people with big ideas and the drive to make them reality. If you have an idea or a dream, this may be the most important book you ever read, filled with hard-nosed, practical advice and commentary drawn from observing the best and brightest America has produced. This book is not a manual but a road map to help the dreamer, the creator and the inventor harness their potential and change their lives by tapping into the power locked within themselves.

    [input_8] => John Rizvi is a Registered and Board Certified Patent Attorney, Adjunct Professor of Intellectual Property Law, recognized Ted Talker, and featured speaker on topics relating to inventing and patents.He perfected his craft at one of the most prestigious and revered patent law firms in the world - a firm that counts Bell, Edison, the Wright Brothers and Ford among its distinguished list of famous inventor clients.Instead of working directly with inventors, however, he found that his time was spent mostly in meetings with in-house lawyers of large, institutional, and corporate clients.  As such, John formed his own law firm 16 years ago so he could work directly with inventors and entrepreneurs in protecting their ideas.

By turns funny and serious, whimsical and straightforward, vulnerable and honest, John Rizvi details his journey from resigning as a patent attorney for one of the most prestigious and revered patent law firms in the world – a firm that counted Bell, Edison, the Wright Brothers and Ford among its distinguished client roster – to going out on his own to represent tomorrow’s leaders in innovation.

Some of the greatest leaps of faith in human history were viewed as madness before they became the revolutionary developments that altered everything about the way<br />we live, work and play. By turns funny and serious, whimsical and straightforward, vulnerable and honest, John Rizvi details his journey from resigning as a patent attorney for one of the most prestigious and revered patent law firms in the world – a firm that counted Bell, Edison, the Wright Brothers and Ford among its distinguished client roster – to going out on his own to represent tomorrow’s leaders in innovation. If you are an inventor or entrepreneur with a new idea, you cannot help but relate to the long, exhilarating, and yet sometimes painful journey of creating something new. Follow along and discover the secrets behind doggedly pursuing your dreams and the courage to risk escaping the gray in your life.<br />

    [input_8] => John Rizvi is a Registered and Board Certified Patent Attorney, Adjunct Professor of Intellectual Property Law, recognized Ted Talker, and featured speaker on topics relating to inventing and patents.He perfected his craft at one of the most prestigious and revered patent law firms in the world - a firm that counts Bell, Edison, the Wright Brothers and Ford among its distinguished list of famous inventor clients.Instead of working directly with inventors, however, he found that his time was spent mostly in meetings with in-house lawyers of large, institutional, and corporate clients.  As such, John formed his own law firm 16 years ago so he could work directly with inventors and entrepreneurs in protecting their ideas.

    [input_1] => Hunter: A Valiant Novel by Joanna White
    [input_2] => A reckless young woman named Averella does what no woman has ever done.<br />She disguises herself as a man and purposefully gets herself arrested and thrown into Zagerah. Her brother Gabriel was taken, and with his disease, he will not survive on his own. She has no idea what to expect inside the prison; all she knows is that once men get taken, they never come back.<br />The Hunters will find her. <br />Genetically altered to be faster and stronger than humans, the Hunters use their powers to find and kill every prisoner who enter Zagerah. The only ones who can defeat them, are in fact, themselves. <br />Jared is a Hunter. It’s all he’s known, all he remembers. He kills ruthlessly and without regret, one prisoner after another. When a new prisoner Dalex shows up, everything begins to change. Jared goes undercover to make Dalex and the other prisoners believe he is one of them, a prisoner himself. <br />No one knows the truth.<br />He will trick them.<br />Toy with them.<br />Then, he will kill them.<br />
    [input_8] => Joanna White earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in Creative Writing for Entertainment at Full Sail University. The Valiant series is her first published work, which first started off being updated on a website called Wattpad. She lives in a small town in Missouri with her husband, where she continues to work on her other upcoming books. Writing has been a passion ever since she was ten, when she wrote her first book. Ever since then, writing has become her life outside of her family, God, and being a nerd.

    [input_8] => William Kurtz is a retured corporate real estate project development attorney. He has traded the equities and commodities markets for 25 years, and has developed the application of \"Japanese Candlesticks\" and \"Elliott Wave,\" in combination, to the markets, since 2003. His previous book, \"Candlesticks for Brighties,\" a Primer on \"Candlesticks,\" teaches that every individual Candlestick price bar is either a \"Classic Spinning Top\" or a variation thereof. He champions the approach to trading the markets which consciously, and always, analyzes price and pattern development fromt the standpoint of both \"Candlesticks\" and \"Elliott Wave,\" which are the basic constituents of his \"Candelaabra\" technical analysis system - \"Beyond Candlesticks\" and \"Beyond Eliott Wave.\"

    [input_1] => Reversal: Unorthodox Candlestick Reversal Patterns
    [input_2] => This book goes beyond classical Japanese Candlesticks to show that extreme readings in price and in certain indicators,as well as unorthodox candlestick trend reversal warning patterns, are accurate predictors of major changes in trend.
    [input_8] => William Kurtz is a retured corporate real estate project development attorney. He has traded the equities and commodities markets for 25 years, and has developed the application of \"Japanese Candlesticks\" and \"Elliott Wave,\" in combination, to the markets, since 2003. His previous book, \"Candlesticks for Brighties,\" a Primer on \"Candlesticks,\" teaches that every individual Candlestick price bar is either a \"Classic Spinning Top\" or a variation thereof. He champions the approach to trading the markets which consciously, and always, analyzes price and pattern development fromt the standpoint of both \"Candlesticks\" and \"Elliott Wave,\" which are the basic constituents of his \"Candelaabra\" technical analysis system - \"Beyond Candlesticks\" and \"Beyond Eliott Wave.\"

    [ninja_forms_field_17] => A vacation on a Nile Cruise in July 1996 is the beginning of Brita’s Egyptian nightmare. On the “Princess Amira” she meets the enigmatic cross-eyed Nubian archaeologist turned tour guide, Abdul. There is a powerful attraction between them and against her better judgment, Brita allows herself to be drawn into his life, a life she will find is filled with mysteries.<br /><br />Brita then attempts to build a new business in the USA with Abdul’s employer, the Egyptian tour company Cataract.. Unwittingly, she has now become involved with a criminal organization whose scope and true nature are unknown. Her quest for the truth about Cataract and Abdul’s true identity puts her through terrifying experiences. She is date-raped by Abdul and stalked by unknown strangers. The FBI, U.S., and Egyptian government officials to whom she turns for help agree to do so at first, but then shut the door on her. <br /><br />Certain friends stand by her - among them is, an independent video artist named Juan. They travel to Egypt together where Brita hopes to find closure. They spend a week in Luxor, much of it with Abdul. He provides some answers about Cataract, but most shocking for Brita is the realization that she and Abdul have fallen in love. In the following months, they cautiously start planning for a possible future. With Brita’s help, Abdul has resumed working on his PHD in Egyptology about the ancient powerful queen Hatshepsut. Brita also makes the big move from the East Coast to Arizona. Then, without warning, Abdul disappears for nearly a month. Only after his return does he tell Brita that he has been in Saudi Arabia on a pilgrimage. She is puzzled because she knows he is not very religious.<br /><br />Shortly after that a strange man and woman start living with Abdul in his apartment and his behavior becomes erratic and often mean. He later explains that the couple was placed there by Cataract. Brita’s letters are either stolen or returned with a lot of Arabic scribbles. Stalking starts again at her new home and is evolving into sheer psycho terror.  Her e-mail, telephone, and computer appear to be tampered with. <br /><br />As the mysteries mount, Abdul becomes more and more secretive. After eight years of his often bizarre behavior, Brita decides to break off all contact. Abdul pleads to give him “a few more months.” Brita makes one last attempt to meet him in Germany but that falls through. She writes him a letter with her address as the sender but it is returned. She writes him a letter from Germany using her aunt’s name and address as the sender. That letter he receives. <br /><br />Through her close friend Hans, who lives in Germany and knows Abdul, Brita then decides to resend the previous letters she had sent to Abdul that were returned to her in the U.S. Hans tells Brita that he will call Abdul and speak with him. However, shortly thereafter, Hans informs Brita by e-mail that he does not want anything to do with her or Abdul because he fears for his and his wife’s life and ends contact. Abdul then also informs Brita that he is breaking off the relationship with her because he is afraid and does not want to hear from her again. <br /><br />Brita is left with an unsolved mystery hoping that the publication of her story might bring some answers.

    [description] => A vacation on a Nile Cruise in July 1996 is the beginning of Brita’s Egyptian nightmare. On the “Princess Amira” she meets the enigmatic cross-eyed Nubian archaeologist turned tour guide, Abdul. There is a powerful attraction between them and against her better judgment, Brita allows herself to be drawn into his life, a life she will find is filled with mysteries.Brita then attempts to build a new business in the USA with Abdul’s employer, the Egyptian tour company Cataract.. Unwittingly, she has now become involved with a criminal organization whose scope and true nature are unknown. Her quest for the truth about Cataract and Abdul’s true identity puts her through terrifying experiences. She is date-raped by Abdul and stalked by unknown strangers. The FBI, U.S., and Egyptian government officials to whom she turns for help agree to do so at first, but then shut the door on her. Certain friends stand by her - among them is, an independent video artist named Juan. They travel to Egypt together where Brita hopes to find closure. They spend a week in Luxor, much of it with Abdul. He provides some answers about Cataract, but most shocking for Brita is the realization that she and Abdul have fallen in love. In the following months, they cautiously start planning for a possible future. With Brita’s help, Abdul has resumed working on his PHD in Egyptology about the ancient powerful queen Hatshepsut. Brita also makes the big move from the East Coast to Arizona. Then, without warning, Abdul disappears for nearly a month. Only after his return does he tell Brita that he has been in Saudi Arabia on a pilgrimage. She is puzzled because she knows he is not very religious.Shortly after that a strange man and woman start living with Abdul in his apartment and his behavior becomes erratic and often mean. He later explains that the couple was placed there by Cataract. Brita’s letters are either stolen or returned with a lot of Arabic scribbles. Stalking starts again at her new home and is evolving into sheer psycho terror.  Her e-mail, telephone, and computer appear to be tampered with. As the mysteries mount, Abdul becomes more and more secretive. After eight years of his often bizarre behavior, Brita decides to break off all contact. Abdul pleads to give him “a few more months.” Brita makes one last attempt to meet him in Germany but that falls through. She writes him a letter with her address as the sender but it is returned. She writes him a letter from Germany using her aunt’s name and address as the sender. That letter he receives. Through her close friend Hans, who lives in Germany and knows Abdul, Brita then decides to resend the previous letters she had sent to Abdul that were returned to her in the U.S. Hans tells Brita that he will call Abdul and speak with him. However, shortly thereafter, Hans informs Brita by e-mail that he does not want anything to do with her or Abdul because he fears for his and his wife’s life and ends contact. Abdul then also informs Brita that he is breaking off the relationship with her because he is afraid and does not want to hear from her again. Brita is left with an unsolved mystery hoping that the publication of her story might bring some answers.

    [field-a6c77a955d5407a] => A vacation on a Nile Cruise in July 1996 is the beginning of Brita’s Egyptian nightmare. On the “Princess Amira” she meets the enigmatic cross-eyed Nubian archaeologist turned tour guide, Abdul. There is a powerful attraction between them and against her better judgment, Brita allows herself to be drawn into his life, a life she will find is filled with mysteries.<br /><br />Brita then attempts to build a new business in the USA with Abdul’s employer, the Egyptian tour company Cataract.. Unwittingly, she has now become involved with a criminal organization whose scope and true nature are unknown. Her quest for the truth about Cataract and Abdul’s true identity puts her through terrifying experiences. She is date-raped by Abdul and stalked by unknown strangers. The FBI, U.S., and Egyptian government officials to whom she turns for help agree to do so at first, but then shut the door on her. <br /><br />Certain friends stand by her - among them is, an independent video artist named Juan. They travel to Egypt together where Brita hopes to find closure. They spend a week in Luxor, much of it with Abdul. He provides some answers about Cataract, but most shocking for Brita is the realization that she and Abdul have fallen in love. In the following months, they cautiously start planning for a possible future. With Brita’s help, Abdul has resumed working on his PHD in Egyptology about the ancient powerful queen Hatshepsut. Brita also makes the big move from the East Coast to Arizona. Then, without warning, Abdul disappears for nearly a month. Only after his return does he tell Brita that he has been in Saudi Arabia on a pilgrimage. She is puzzled because she knows he is not very religious.<br /><br />Shortly after that a strange man and woman start living with Abdul in his apartment and his behavior becomes erratic and often mean. He later explains that the couple was placed there by Cataract. Brita’s letters are either stolen or returned with a lot of Arabic scribbles. Stalking starts again at her new home and is evolving into sheer psycho terror.  Her e-mail, telephone, and computer appear to be tampered with. <br /><br />As the mysteries mount, Abdul becomes more and more secretive. After eight years of his often bizarre behavior, Brita decides to break off all contact. Abdul pleads to give him “a few more months.” Brita makes one last attempt to meet him in Germany but that falls through. She writes him a letter with her address as the sender but it is returned. She writes him a letter from Germany using her aunt’s name and address as the sender. That letter he receives. <br /><br />Through her close friend Hans, who lives in Germany and knows Abdul, Brita then decides to resend the previous letters she had sent to Abdul that were returned to her in the U.S. Hans tells Brita that he will call Abdul and speak with him. However, shortly thereafter, Hans informs Brita by e-mail that he does not want anything to do with her or Abdul because he fears for his and his wife’s life and ends contact. Abdul then also informs Brita that he is breaking off the relationship with her because he is afraid and does not want to hear from her again. <br /><br />Brita is left with an unsolved mystery hoping that the publication of her story might bring some answers.

    [author] => Rodney  Koop
    [description] => Putting the profit into a service company requires understanding why people won\'t pay you what you are worth. Your price is your power and cash is king. In home services like plumbing, electrical, heating and air, pest control, carpet cleaning, roofing, siding or whatever you do can be not only profitable but pleasant for you and your customer. After 20 years struggling and trying to get technicians to sell and up sell in the homes Rodney Koop finally found the solution. Sell them exactly \"how\" they already buy every day. Amazon, Best Buy, Home Depot, don\'t they make it look easy. I\'ll show you their secret and on the way show you a business model that actually works every day.

It was an interesting request, but as a lifelong educator with a specialization in teaching & learning, Dr. Brown decided to take on the challenge. The result is \"Joker to King,\" the very first book that actually teaches GUYS how to become MEN. There\'s a difference between being a GUY and being a MAN, and sometimes it\'s difficult to make that transition into manhood. There are many books to READ on masculinity and manhood, but \"Joker to King\" is the only book you\'ll actually USE week after week. The 52 lessons in \"Joker to King\" are organized according to the 52 playing cards in a deck, allowing you to complete your manhood journey within a full 52-week calendar year. In each chapter, you get an explanation of the lesson, a story exemplifying the lesson, and an assignment to actually put the lesson into practice. By the time you finish the entire book, you\'ll understand how to better manage your relationships, manage your resources, manage your environments, and manage yourself.

    [title] => Joker to King: Your 52-Week Initiation into Manhood
    [author] => Robert Daylin Brown
    [description] => A few years ago, professor Robert Daylin Brown was challenged to write the curriculum that would teach someone how to be a man. It was an interesting request, but as a lifelong educator with a specialization in teaching & learning, Dr. Brown decided to take on the challenge. The result is \"Joker to King,\" the very first book that actually teaches GUYS how to become MEN. There\'s a difference between being a GUY and being a MAN, and sometimes it\'s difficult to make that transition into manhood. There are many books to READ on masculinity and manhood, but \"Joker to King\" is the only book you\'ll actually USE week after week. The 52 lessons in \"Joker to King\" are organized according to the 52 playing cards in a deck, allowing you to complete your manhood journey within a full 52-week calendar year. In each chapter, you get an explanation of the lesson, a story exemplifying the lesson, and an assignment to actually put the lesson into practice. By the time you finish the entire book, you\'ll understand how to better manage your relationships, manage your resources, manage your environments, and manage yourself.

It was an interesting request, but as a lifelong educator with a specialization in teaching & learning, Dr. Brown decided to take on the challenge. The result is \"Joker to King,\" the very first book that actually teaches GUYS how to become MEN. There\'s a difference between being a GUY and being a MAN, and sometimes it\'s difficult to make that transition into manhood. There are many books to READ on masculinity and manhood, but \"Joker to King\" is the only book you\'ll actually USE week after week. The 52 lessons in \"Joker to King\" are organized according to the 52 playing cards in a deck, allowing you to complete your manhood journey within a full 52-week calendar year. In each chapter, you get an explanation of the lesson, a story exemplifying the lesson, and an assignment to actually put the lesson into practice. By the time you finish the entire book, you\'ll understand how to better manage your relationships, manage your resources, manage your environments, and manage yourself.

    [input_8] => Jill Davis has always been an adventurer, seeking out others that shared her passions. When she met George it was the perfect match. As soon as fate brought them together they have been a force to be reckoned with in the wilds of Alaska. Jill grew up in Cordova, Alaska commercial fishing, sport fishing, flying airplanes, and becoming an entrepreneur. One of her many passions is writing. She excelled in the sport fish and adventure guide industry, and built Icy Bay Lodge with George. After selling the lodge, Jill was able to have more time to pursue her writing. George and Jill started Alaska Wild Adventures, filming and documenting true life living off of the grid in the wilds of Alaska. Through Alaska Man novels George and Jill are able to give this special gift of a true legacy. The story of how legends are sought and dreams come true.

    [input_1] => Alaska Man: A Memoir of Growing Up and Living in the Wilds of Alaska
    [input_2] => Intriguing LARGER THAN LIFE story of George Davis and his intoxicating adventures of growing up in Alaska\'s untamed, and unforgiving environment. He survives this perilous wheel of fortune, and thrives in the face of danger! <br /><br />I would like to add to why my book is important, is that we are true authentic Alaskans that live life off of the grid and that we have been entrepreneurs, making our living off of the land and sea. We are wilderness and off the grid consultants if that is important. On our website we have a variety of things we consult on from sport fishing, hunting, adventures, lodges/outfitters, developing or improving remote properties, and much more.
    [input_8] => Jill Davis has always been an adventurer, seeking out others that shared her passions. When she met George it was the perfect match. As soon as fate brought them together they have been a force to be reckoned with in the wilds of Alaska. Jill grew up in Cordova, Alaska commercial fishing, sport fishing, flying airplanes, and becoming an entrepreneur. One of her many passions is writing. She excelled in the sport fish and adventure guide industry, and built Icy Bay Lodge with George. After selling the lodge, Jill was able to have more time to pursue her writing. George and Jill started Alaska Wild Adventures, filming and documenting true life living off of the grid in the wilds of Alaska. Through Alaska Man novels George and Jill are able to give this special gift of a true legacy. The story of how legends are sought and dreams come true.

    [title] => Own Your BS: The No-Nonsense guide to your female Head Talk
    [author] => Bree  Stedman
    [description] => Why is it that, even though there are thousands of Self-Help books available to help women develop confidence in themselves and their dreams, women are more stuck in Negative Head Talk than ever before?  Because most Self-Help books are written with a logical, male point of view in mind.  Own Your BS: The No-Nonsense guide to addressing your Female Head Talk explores the differences between men and women and, without the fluff and rah-rah of \'just visualise\' and \'think positive\', provides readers with practical and powerful strategies and tools to get a grip on stories like \"I\'m not good enough\", \"I\'ll fail\", \"she is better than me\" and \"I should....\" by understanding what drives these stories in the first place.  Complete with downloadable templates, Own Your BS will give you not just the insight, but the strategies to take back your Personal Power and rephrase the Head Talk to serve you and influence your success.

    [input_2] => Why is it that, even though there are thousands of Self-Help books available to help women develop confidence in themselves and their dreams, women are more stuck in Negative Head Talk than ever before?  <br /><br />Because most Self-Help books are written with a logical, male point of view in mind.  <br /><br />Own Your BS: The No-Nonsense guide to addressing your Female Head Talk explores the differences between men and women and, without the fluff and rah-rah of \'just visualise\' and \'think positive\', provides readers with practical and powerful strategies and tools to get a grip on stories like \"I\'m not good enough\", \"I\'ll fail\", \"she is better than me\" and \"I should....\" by understanding what drives these stories in the first place.  <br /><br />Complete with downloadable templates, Own Your BS will give you not just the insight, but the strategies to take back your Personal Power and rephrase the Head Talk to serve you and influence your success.
