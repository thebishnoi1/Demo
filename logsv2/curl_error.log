    [vfb-17] => Danny Is Different is a children\'s illustrated story for kids of all ages. Vivid art with Spanish and English words on one side make reading easy for grandparents and encourages learning a second language. It teaches values of tenacity, love, and self-worth. Bullying from the community in awkward social situations such as gossip and peer pressure ultimately are resolved as the characters overcome prejudices, at home and in the community. Danny, a little green snake born odd, becomes a champion, and centers around being unique and accepting others who may appear physically different.

    [input_26] => <i>Think and Grow Rich </i>is the bestselling self-help book of all time. Now, patent attorney John Rizvi applies a unique twist to the lessons Napoleon Hill offered to millions of would-be entrepreneurs, making them relevant to inventors and innovators of all stripes. John has helped hundreds of inventors in realizing their dreams, from modest success stories to clients who sold their intellectual property for hundreds of millions of dollars.<br /><br /><i>Think and Grow Rich for Inventors</i> is the distilled essence of John\'s experience over nearly two decades of directly and personally guiding inventors through the often frustrating process of obtaining a patent in the US and abroad while working to understand the deeper passions that dive them. He brings a personal touch to the ideas Napoleon Hill codified, describing his own experiences with these principles in unflinching, often humorous, sometimes self-mocking, always thought-provoking terms.<br /><br /><i>Think and Grow Rich for Inventors</i> is geared specifically toward people with big ideas and the drive to make them reality. If you have an idea or a dream, this may be the most important book you ever read, filled with hard-nosed, practical advice and commentary drawn from observing the best and brightest America has produced. This book is not a manual but a road map to help the dreamer, the creator and the inventor harness their potential and change their lives by tapping into the power locked within themselves.

    [vfb-13] => http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01GR4S86U
    [vfb-22] => Biographies & Memoirs
    [vfb-17] => A vacation on a Nile Cruise in July 1996 is the beginning of Brita’s Egyptian nightmare. On the “Princess Amira” she meets the enigmatic cross-eyed Nubian archaeologist turned tour guide, Abdul. There is a powerful attraction between them and against her better judgment, Brita allows herself to be drawn into his life, a life she will find is filled with mysteries.<br /><br />Brita then attempts to build a new business in the USA with Abdul’s employer, the Egyptian tour company Cataract.. Unwittingly, she has now become involved with a criminal organization whose scope and true nature are unknown. Her quest for the truth about Cataract and Abdul’s true identity puts her through terrifying experiences. She is date-raped by Abdul and stalked by unknown strangers. The FBI, U.S., and Egyptian government officials to whom she turns for help agree to do so at first, but then shut the door on her. <br /><br />Certain friends stand by her - among them is, an independent video artist named Juan. They travel to Egypt together where Brita hopes to find closure. They spend a week in Luxor, much of it with Abdul. He provides some answers about Cataract, but most shocking for Brita is the realization that she and Abdul have fallen in love. In the following months, they cautiously start planning for a possible future. With Brita’s help, Abdul has resumed working on his PHD in Egyptology about the ancient powerful queen Hatshepsut. Brita also makes the big move from the East Coast to Arizona. Then, without warning, Abdul disappears for nearly a month. Only after his return does he tell Brita that he has been in Saudi Arabia on a pilgrimage. She is puzzled because she knows he is not very religious.<br /><br />Shortly after that a strange man and woman start living with Abdul in his apartment and his behavior becomes erratic and often mean. He later explains that the couple was placed there by Cataract. Brita’s letters are either stolen or returned with a lot of Arabic scribbles. Stalking starts again at her new home and is evolving into sheer psycho terror.  Her e-mail, telephone, and computer appear to be tampered with. <br /><br />As the mysteries mount, Abdul becomes more and more secretive. After eight years of his often bizarre behavior, Brita decides to break off all contact. Abdul pleads to give him “a few more months.” Brita makes one last attempt to meet him in Germany but that falls through. She writes him a letter with her address as the sender but it is returned. She writes him a letter from Germany using her aunt’s name and address as the sender. That letter he receives. <br /><br />Through her close friend Hans, who lives in Germany and knows Abdul, Brita then decides to resend the previous letters she had sent to Abdul that were returned to her in the U.S. Hans tells Brita that he will call Abdul and speak with him. However, shortly thereafter, Hans informs Brita by e-mail that he does not want anything to do with her or Abdul because he fears for his and his wife’s life and ends contact. Abdul then also informs Brita that he is breaking off the relationship with her because he is afraid and does not want to hear from her again. <br /><br />Brita is left with an unsolved mystery hoping that the publication of her story might bring some answers.

    [vfb-22] => Advice & How-to
    [vfb-17] => A few years ago, professor Robert Daylin Brown was challenged to write the curriculum that would teach someone how to be a man. It was an interesting request, but as a lifelong educator with a specialization in teaching & learning, Dr. Brown decided to take on the challenge. The result is \"Joker to King,\" the very first book that actually teaches GUYS how to become MEN. There\'s a difference between being a GUY and being a MAN, and sometimes it\'s difficult to make that transition into manhood. There are many books to READ on masculinity and manhood, but \"Joker to King\" is the only book you\'ll actually USE week after week. The 52 lessons in \"Joker to King\" are organized according to the 52 playing cards in a deck, allowing you to complete your manhood journey within a full 52-week calendar year. In each chapter, you get an explanation of the lesson, a story exemplifying the lesson, and an assignment to actually put the lesson into practice. By the time you finish the entire book, you\'ll understand how to better manage your relationships, manage your resources, manage your environments, and manage yourself.

    [input_26] => A few years ago, professor Robert Daylin Brown was challenged to write the curriculum that would teach someone how to be a man. It was an interesting request, but as a lifelong educator with a specialization in teaching & learning, Dr. Brown decided to take on the challenge. The result is \"Joker to King,\" the very first book that actually teaches GUYS how to become MEN. There\'s a difference between being a GUY and being a MAN, and sometimes it\'s difficult to make that transition into manhood. There are many books to READ on masculinity and manhood, but \"Joker to King\" is the only book you\'ll actually USE week after week. The 52 lessons in \"Joker to King\" are organized according to the 52 playing cards in a deck, allowing you to complete your manhood journey within a full 52-week calendar year. In each chapter, you get an explanation of the lesson, a story exemplifying the lesson, and an assignment to actually put the lesson into practice. By the time you finish the entire book, you\'ll understand how to better manage your relationships, manage your resources, manage your environments, and manage yourself.

    [vfb-17] => Intriguing LARGER THAN LIFE story of George Davis and his intoxicating adventures of growing up in Alaska\'s untamed, and unforgiving environment. He survives this perilous wheel of fortune, and thrives in the face of danger! <br /><br />I would like to add to why my book is important, is that we are true authentic Alaskans that live life off of the grid and that we have been entrepreneurs, making our living off of the land and sea. We are wilderness and off the grid consultants if that is important. On our website we have a variety of things we consult on from sport fishing, hunting, adventures, lodges/outfitters, developing or improving remote properties, and much more.
